README file for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Project
Author: Tamas Kerekjarto

In order to fulfill the requirements of the course project please:
1. Make sure your default library path contains a directory called data in which the sample files are placed with the same
    file structure and naming convention as indicated in the project description
2. Run the run_analysis.R code file that will load in all necessary files and generate two data sets.
3. Generated data sets are : final_combined_set and tidyData; first being the combined training and test data sets merged with subjects and activity labels and the second being the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
4. Both data sets are written out to seperate txt files under the directory "data" named: final_combined_set.txt and second_tidy_data_set.txt
5. The code assumes that the packages plyr and reshape2 are installed!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6. run_analysis.R contains step by step code comments describing each function calls.

Enjoy!!!!
